Estebank is a chatbot created to assist clients of the bank XYZ using IBM Watson Assistant.


## Usage

Based on [this online course](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/how-to-build-a-chatbot) 

The lab of the first module will explain you how to create and set up an account on ibm cloud (a cloud computing service offered by IBM) where we gonna deploy our chatbot service. 

After the registration you can skip directly to module 6 and upload the skills file following the instructions of the section "Help! It didn't work.". 

If you want to adapt and personalize it, you can add some intents (it basically detects phrases and words that are useful to match with clients necessities). For example, in this chatbot there is one for loans and other for interest rates, so you can look for #interests_info and/or #loans_info (intents are identificated with a hashtag) and add more examples, a good practice is to provide 5 questions or phrases that request the same information per intent.

Following the example, to change the answers for loan or interest types of the bot helper go to the tab dialog and select Loan Types and/or Interest Types and modify the answers (in the screenshot is the text selected).
